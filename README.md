# Portfolio

My web site written with **Python** and **Django** where
I will publish my destinations and projects.
Also it was made to try basic web frontend technologies
like **CSS** (still hate it), **HTML** and **JS**
(just wrote too small functions).

## Prerequisites

- docker engine >= 20.10
- docker-compose >= 1.12

## Build and run

This project uses docker images and compose for building it, so
you may simply change change `.env` file and environmental variables in
`Dockerfile` (must be fixed in near future). And finally run:
> docker-compose up -d --build
